# Face Memory Game

A [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) app to find all matching hex as soon as possible!


Currently we use only [RStudio hex stickers](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers), but you can clone the repo and put any hex you want into `www/hex/` directory.

To run the application locally (faster than online version below) use:

```r
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "dreamRs/memory-hex")
```
